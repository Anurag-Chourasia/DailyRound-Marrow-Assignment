# Dailyrounds Assignment
 
Dependecy required 
Kingfisherâ€¨ - 7.12.0


My findings, learnings, or feedback.

1) The Api's were not just regular api, one of them had a http call which makes it unsecure so the project's info needs to have App Transport Security Settings dictionary which allows Allow Arbitrary Loads - YES

2) One of the simpliest project yet so many small details to look at such as api calls, maintain ui, saving to core data and fetching from core data.

3) User specific bookmarks are maintained.

Thanks for giving me a chance.

Hope you like my projects!!!
